# Emotion Based Music Recommendation System

# 🎵 RhythmiQ – Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview

FaceBeats is an emotion-based music recommendation system that uses facial expression recognition to detect a user’s emotional state in real time and automatically play music that matches their mood. By combining Computer Vision and Deep Learning, the system delivers a personalized and emotionally intelligent music experience without requiring any manual input from the user.
The system captures live video through a webcam, detects the user’s face using OpenCV, predicts emotions using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and recommends music accordingly. This project demonstrates how AI can understand human emotions and enhance digital experiences through smart automation.
